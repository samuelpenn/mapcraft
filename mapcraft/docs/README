Latest source and everything else can be obtained there.

INSTALL AND RUN
---------------

Scripts have been included for both UNIX and MS Windows, though the
latter have not been tested. If you have downloaded the tarball,
then the software can be run using either of the two scripts
(mapcraft for UNIX, mapcraft.bat for MS Windows).

To see a sample map, try (on UNIX):
./mapcraft -load maps/island.map

Requirements
------------

You will need at least Java 1.4 - it has been tested on 1.4.2, but
may work on previous versions of 1.4. Ensure that java is in your
PATH before running the scripts.

To compile the sources, you will also need Ant 1.6. Earlier versions
of Ant do not have all the required libraries bundled with them, so
extra libraries will also be required.

WHAT IS IT?

Mapcraft is a Java application for creating and editing maps
for use in a roleplaying game. The style of maps generated
are hex based maps, in a style similar to that used for the
large scale Harn maps.

Currently, it is in the very early stages of development,
but it can be used to create and save maps. The maps are
saved in an XML file format, so can be exported to other
programs using a bit of XML.

Currently, there is very little documentation, it's somewhat
slow, and needs a lot of extra features before it becomes
really useful. See the PLAN for a list of planned features.

It has only been tested on Linux, using JDK 1.4. You will
also need the Apache xerces jar files in your CLASSPATH.

RUNNING

To run, you should be able to use:

./mapcraft

You may need to source the profile first. There are several
example maps in the 'maps' directory.
