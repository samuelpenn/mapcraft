        <h1>Mapcraft Templates</h1>

        <p>
            Templates hold descriptions of tiles and objects for use in a
            map. By default, there are two types of templates - hexagonal
            templates for world maps, and square templates for local area
            maps.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each template has associated images to go with them. All images
            are stored as square tiles, at 96x96 resolution, then rescaled
            and reshaped to fit the type and zoom of map on display.
        </p>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>

        <h4>Terrain</h4>

        <p>
            Terrain is the lowest level layer drawn on the map. Very simply,
            it is what people walk on, rather than bump into. In world maps,
            it describes the general vegetation and climate.
        </p>

        <h4>Features</h4>

        <p>
            Features modify the terrain, or sit upon it. Hills and mountains
            are features (in world maps), as are walls and doors (in local
            maps). Features are always drawn ontop of the terrain tile.
        </p>

        <h4>Things</h4>

        <p>
            Things are free floating objects which are not restricted to the
            tile grid. Multiple things can be on the same tile. On world
            maps, things are towns and cities. On local maps, they are
            tables, beds and chests.
        </p>

                    <p>
                        Sea represents relatively shallow water, either
                        coastal salt water or inland fresh water. It
                        should be used where sea travel in small boats is
                        easy.

                    <p>
                        Ocean is deep water, nearly always salt water. Such
                        waters are rarely travelled in small boats because
                        of rough seas and being far from the sight of land.

                        Wetlands are low laying areas half-water, half-land.

                    <h4>Cropland</h4>

                    <p>
                        Cropland is cultivated farmland, consisting of fields,
                        pasture and light woodland. Villages and farms tend to
                        be common in this type of terrain, which is very much
                        man made.

                    <h4>Grasslands</h4>

                    <p>
                        Grassland is flat plains, often home to herd animals
                        predators alike. It may be pasture for tamed animals,
                        though is more likely to be wilderness. At any rate,
                        there isn't much difference between the two.

                    <h4>Dry Grassland</h4>

                    <p>
                        Similar to grassland, dry grassland is flat
                        grasslands, though the climate is bordering on
                        semi-desert. Water, though not scarce, is in short
                        display. Plants are hardy varieties, and may come
                        and go with the seasons.

                    <p>
                        Rock desert is true desert - little or no rainfall,
                        and hardly any growing plants. It may be hot or cold
                        depending on the climate. The surface consists of
                        pebbles and bolders. In hilly terrain, dry river
                        valleys are weathered rocks will be common.

                    <p>
                        This is the stereotypical desert of hot sand dunes,
                        sand storms and rare oasis.
