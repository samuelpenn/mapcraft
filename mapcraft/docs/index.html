        <p>
            This documentation is for Mapcraft 0.2.2.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mapcraft is a Java application for drawing tiled maps for use in
            pen and paper roleplaying games. Maps are built up using several
            layers of detail - the base terrain (grasslands, forest), followed
            by features (hills, mountains) and then vector paths (rivers and
            roads) and things (cities, towns, points of interest).
        </p>

        <p>
            Mapcraft can cope with either square or hexagonal maps, for both
            indoor and outdoor locations.
