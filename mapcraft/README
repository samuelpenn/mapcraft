The main project home page is now at:
http://mapcraft.sourceforge.net/

Latest source and everything else can be obtained there.

INSTALL AND RUN
---------------

Use the scripts to run the Java application. The scripts set up any needed
CLASSPATH before calling the program. At the very least, the XALAN_HOME
variable needs to be set to point to the directory containing xalan.jar
and xercesImpl.jar.

These files can be obtained from http://xml.apache.org if you do not have
them on your system.

On UNIX, to run and test the application, use:
./mapcraft -load maps/island.map

Under MS Windows, it should be something similar with mapcraft.bat, but
this hasn't been tested.



DEPENDENCIES

ant 1.6


WHAT IS IT?

Mapcraft is a Java application for creating and editing maps
for use in a roleplaying game. The style of maps generated
are hex based maps, in a style similar to that used for the
large scale Harn maps.

Currently, it is in the very early stages of development,
but it can be used to create and save maps. The maps are
saved in an XML file format, so can be exported to other
programs using a bit of XML.

Currently, there is very little documentation, it's somewhat
slow, and needs a lot of extra features before it becomes
really useful. See the PLAN for a list of planned features.

It has only been tested on Linux, using JDK 1.4. You will
also need the Apache xerces jar files in your CLASSPATH.

RUNNING

To run, you should be able to use:

./mapcraft

You may need to source the profile first. There are several
example maps in the 'maps' directory.
