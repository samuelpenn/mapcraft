WHAT IS IT?

Mapcraft is a Java application for creating and editing maps
for use in a roleplaying game. The style of maps generated
are hex based maps, in a style similar to that used for the
large scale Harn maps.

Currently, it is in the very early stages of development,
but it can be used to create and save maps. The maps are
saved in an XML file format, so can be exported to other
programs using a bit of XML.

Currently, there is very little documentation, it's somewhat
slow, and needs a lot of extra features before it becomes
really useful. See the PLAN for a list of planned features.

RUNNING

There are four varieties of map, governed by two flags.
World scale maps have hexagonal tiles (this is the default).
Local area maps often use square tiles. Use -local and -square
to switch on the latter features when creating a map.

For the latter, you also need to point things at the square
tiles rather than the default hexagonal ones.

To view one of the sample maps, run the program as follows:

./mapcraft -load maps/Harn.map
or
./mapcraft -load maps/Euressa.map
or
./mapcraft -load maps/gargun.map

To create a new map:

./mapcraft -create mymap -width 200 -height 150 \
           -scale 25 -terrain terrain/hexagonal.xml

./mapcraft -create mymap -width 200 -height 150 \
           -scale 1 -terrain terrain/square.xml \
           -square -local

Everything else you'll have to figure out for yourself.
