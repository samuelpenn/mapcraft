WHAT IS IT?

Mapcraft is a Java application for creating and editing maps
for use in a roleplaying game. The style of maps generated
are hex based maps, in a style similar to that used for the
large scale Harn maps.

Currently, it is in the very early stages of development,
but it can be used to create and save maps. The maps are
saved in an XML file format, so can be exported to other
programs using a bit of XML.

Currently, there is very little documentation, it's somewhat
slow, and needs a lot of extra features before it becomes
really useful. See the PLAN for a list of planned features.

RUNNING

To run, you should be able to use:

./mapcraft

You may need to source the profile first. There are several
example maps in the 'maps' directory.
