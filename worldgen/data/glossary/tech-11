#Technology Level 11

<p>
Worlds of TL 11 are considered to be slightly behind standard Imperium
technology. Items will be somewhat bulkier, slower and less reliable than
their cutting edge Imperium counterparts. Most of what is available
within TL 12 cultures is available at TL 11, simply inferior and more
expensive.
