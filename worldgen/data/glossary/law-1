#Law Level 1 (Very Free)

<p>
A <e>very free</e> level of law has few laws - generally the minimum needed
to maintain a functioning society. Property ownership, taxes and a monetary
system are about all that are enforced. Law enforcement is often left to
vigilantes, or at best locally formed militias.
