#Subsector capital

<p>
The Imperium is organised into sectors for political and administrative
purposes, and each sector is further sub-divided into 16 subsectors
Normally, a single system in each <a href="subsector">subsector</a>
is designated as the subsector capital, which is denoted by the trade
code <em>Cp</em>.
</p>

<p>
The subsector capital is often the most important world of the subsector,
either through trade, military might or political connections. Of course,
most subsector capitals were defined during the formation of the Third
Imperium, and changes in trade and politics may mean that the capital
world isn't as important as it once once, but still holds the title of
sub sector capital.

The <a href="duke">Duke</a> of the subsector is based at this world.
