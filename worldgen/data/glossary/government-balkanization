#Balkanized States

<p>
The world is split into many different nation states. Unlike an <i>Anarchy</i>,
a balkanized world is mostly stable, and the different nation states have
learnt to work together at least some of the time. There may be a world
organisation that represents the different states and which provides a means
for them to settle their differences without war.
