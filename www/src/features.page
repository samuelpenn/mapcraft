        <p>
            Mapcraft is a Java based tool for creating and managing maps
            for use in pen and paper roleplaying games. Maps are tile
            based, and make use of properties and meta data to keep track
            of objects and manage relationships between different maps.

            <p>
                Mapcraft is still in development, and is considered to be
                very much alpha software. It should be stable, however many
                of the desired features are yet to be implemented, and some
                which do work, either have no GUI or are rough around the
                edges.
            </p>

            <p>
                The current aim is to tidy up the existing features so that
                they work well from the GUI without requiring in depth
                knowledge from the user.

                    <title>Hexagonal and Square maps</title>

                    <p>
                        Mapcraft uses tiled maps rather than vectors,
                        mostly for simplicity, but it also avoids the
                        problem vector maps have that they get
                        significantly slower the more detailed they
                        become.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Maps can be specified to use either square tiles
                        or hexagons, depending on the style preferred
                        by the user. Square tiles are better suited to
                        indoor maps, whilst hexagons tend to be used
                        for large scale world maps.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A well designed vector map will generally look
                        better than a well designed tiled map, but few
                        maps are well designed, and a small tile size
                        can alleviate most of the problems.

                    <title>Vectors for Rivers and Roads</title>

                    <p>
                        Rivers and roads are represented as vectors on
                        the map, so they are not constrained to the
                        tile grid. All paths can have a name associated
                        with it, and can be given a specified width,
                        colour and style.

                    <p>
                        Sites (called 'things' in Mapcraft) such as
                        towns, cities, mines etc are shown as free
                        floating objects which aren't restricted to the
                        tile grid.

                    <p>
                        World maps can be generated ready for outputting
                        to 3D modelling software. See

                    <title>Xalan Plugin</title>

                    <p>
                        There is a Xalan plugin which allows maps to be
                        generated from an XML call. This is used by
                        <link href="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net"
                              name="Yagsbook"/>
                        to automatically generate maps from RPG
                        documentation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, an article about a particular city
                        can link to a map, and specify that it wants a
                        small map displayed of the region around the city.

                    <title>XML Data files</title>

                    <p>
                        All map data is currently stored in XML files
                        making them reasonably easy to parse.

                    <title>Object meta data</title>

                    <p>
                        Most objects in the map can have metadata
                        associated with it. For example, a town or
                        city can record its population, allegience
                        or background information.

                    <title>More GUI Options</title>

                    <p>
                        Currently not all features are supported by a
                        GUI interface - this needs to be rectified though
                        it is not high on the priority list.

                    <title>Database support</title>

                    <p>
                        Currently it is difficult to support very large
                        maps - in the order of thousands of tiles across.
                        The code has recently been re-written to support
                        multiple storage formats, and there is work in
                        progress to add database support to Mapcraft.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This will enable maps to be transparently tiled,
                        keeping only the necessary parts in memory. The
                        plan is to allow world maps tens of thousands of
                        tiles across.

                        populations per region.
