        <p>
            Mapcraft is a Java based tool for creating and managing maps
            for use in pen and paper roleplaying games. Maps are tile
            based, and make use of properties and meta data to keep track
            of objects and manage relationships between different maps.

                <e>Mapcraft</e> is a tile based map editor for pen and paper
                roleplaying games. It is designed to handle everything from
                complete world maps (including spherical worlds, like the
                image shown here) down to local village maps, automatically
                keeping track of where smaller maps are located within
                their larger scale parents.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maps can be rescaled, merged (so maps of neighbouring
                areas can overlap, whilst remaining consistent) and
                cropped. More importantly, metadata can be stored on any
                object within the map. For example, you could store
                population data about towns and villages, keep track of
                who rules them and what their feudal obligations are.
                Then it would be possible to automatically generate
                population and fief statistics on a country for inclusion
                in another document.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Maps are stored as XML data, so can be accessed
                programmatically via standard XML APIs. There are already
                plugins for <link href="http://xml.apache.org"
                name="Xalan"/> which allow a JPEG image to be created
                from a map automatically and inserted into a Document.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is different from the normal aim of just trying to
                create maps which look pretty. The idea is to have
                pretty maps as well, though this is secondary. Consistency
                and good support for meta data is held to be more important.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Mapcraft is written in Java 1.4, and requires JRE 1.4
                    in order to run. It has been developed on Linux, but
                    has also been tested on MS Windows. It should run on
                    any operating system that supports Java, and which
                    has a graphical display (due to the way some things
                    have been implemented, some of the backend functions
                    also require a graphical environment, though this is
                    on the list of things to fix).
