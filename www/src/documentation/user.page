                <p>
                    The relationship between maps is best described with
                    an example. Imagine a map of a continent, defined to
                    have a scale of 1 tile = 25km. At some point later,
                    it becomes desirable to detail one region of the map
                    at a higher resolution, maybe 1 tile = 5km.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When this is done, the region is selected and cropped
                    (maybe a 30x30 tile part of the original map). After
                    cropping, the new map is rescaled to the higher
                    resolution, giving a 150x150 tile map, with each tile
                    representing 5km.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The original map is the parent, the new map the child.
                    The child map keeps a record of their parent, and also
                    the location in the parent from which they were cut.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If a third map is generated from the parent, then
                    both children are siblings of each other, and may
                    overlap. Facilities exist to <em>merge</em> siblings
                    so that overlapping areas are forced to be identical.
                    Changes to the children can also be ported back into
                    the parent (though at the lower resolution).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The hierarchy of maps becomes important when such
                    merging is done, but it is all kept track of
                    transparently by the application.

                    <item term="Template">
                        A template holds descriptions of tiles and objects
                        for use in a map. Each template has associated
                        images to go with it, and defines whether the map
                        has hexagonal or square tiles.
                    </item>
                    
                    <item term="Terrain">
                        Terrain is the lowest level layer drawn on the map.
                        It is what people walk on, rather than bump into. In
                        world maps it describes the general vegetation and
                        climate.
                    </item>
                    
                    <item term="Features">
                        Features modify the terrain, or sit upon it. Hills
                        and mountains are features in world maps. Walls and
                        doors are features in local maps. Features are
                        always drawn ontop of a terrain tile, and each tile
                        has at most a single feature.
                    </item>
                    
                    <item term="Things">
                        Things are free floating objects which are not based
                        on the tile grid. Multiple things can sit on the
                        same tile, or across two or more tiles. Things can
                        be of any shape or size. On world maps, things
                        represent towns and cities. On local maps, they may
                        be tables, beds or chests.
                    </item>
                    
                    <item term="Path">
                        A path is a free floating line on the map. Like
                        things, they are not restricted to tiles. They
                        generally represent roads or rivers.
