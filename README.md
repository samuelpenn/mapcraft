A project for managing maps, also includes world and star system generation.

Mapcraft
--------

A Java client application for drawing maps. Has been replaced by Cartexography,
which can be found at https://github.com/samuelpenn/cartexography

WorldGen
--------

The _WorldGen_ project is the currently active part, having grown out of a
feature of Mapcraft to randomly generate world maps and wrap them around
planets. It now aims to simulate a Traveller-like universe.

Includes:
* Generate complete star systems from a UWP.
* Generate random worlds and star systems.
* Generate random world surface maps (for all types of worlds).
* Generate random textual descriptions of world societies.
* Simulate a world's economy.
* Simulate movement of spacecraft between worlds.
* Simulate trade between worlds.
* Generate/simulate all of the above for a galactic empire.

Not all of this has been implemented yet.
