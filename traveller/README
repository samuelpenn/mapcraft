A few notes on building this.

There are two configuration files which need to be copied and changed.
These are:
  ant.example
  src/uk/org/glendale/rpg/traveller/build.example

These are the SVN versions of the two configuration files ant.properties
and build.properties. They should be copied to *.properties, and configured
with the location/passwords etc of database and application servers.

If the ANT build tells you to read the README, then it probably can't
find these two files.

The *.example version of the files should never contain real passwords
and server names. Use local copies instead for this.
