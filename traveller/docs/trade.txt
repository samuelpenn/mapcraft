How will trading work?

High tech goods based on tech level, rather than having different TL
versions of the same good.

e.g.:

TL6: Mechanical Computers
TL7: Electronic Computers
TL8: Micro Computers
TL9: Advanced Computers


Basic stuff:

Food
Textiles
Minerals
Alloys
Machinary
Computers

Minerals

Silicate - Basic rocks/olvine
Carbonic - Organic/Plastics
Ferric   - Metals
Uranic   - Radioactives
Argen    - Precious metals
Aquam    - Water/Hydrogen/Oxygen
