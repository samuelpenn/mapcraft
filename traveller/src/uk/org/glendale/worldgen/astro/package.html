		The <strong>uk.org.glendale.worldgen.astro</strong> package holds the
		entity definitions and logic for all astronomical objects within the
		universe. This includes sectors, star systems, stars and planets.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Each type of entity has its own package, which includes entities,
		factories, generators and API classes. The format of each package is
		similar for each, and code has been split across several classes to
		try and reduce the maintenance headache.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Entity</h4>
	
	<p>
		The entity class describes the meta data for the entity, and contains
		only a minimal amount of logic (if any). The idea is to keep these as
		simple as possible. They are named for the entity.
	</p>
	
	<h4>API</h4>
	
	<p>
		These are named as &lt;entityt&gt;API, and contain the logic for the
		entity during its lifetime, as well as declaring public methods for
		controlling the entity. Web Services are defined in here using
		javax.ws.* annotations.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Factory</h4>
	
	<p>
		These are named as &lt;entity&gt;Factory, and contain the logic for
		fetching existing instances of this entity.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Generator</h4>

	<p>
		These are named as &lt;entity&gt;Generator, and contain the logic for
		creating new instances of this entity. Creation logic is separated from
		fetching logic because for many of these entities, creation is very
		complex but happens rarely. By splitting it from the Factory class, we
		allow the Factory class (which is used frequently) to be simpler.
