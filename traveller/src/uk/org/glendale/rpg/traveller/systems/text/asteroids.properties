# Asteroids
#
# The following phrases are all root phrases for asteroid type worlds.
# They can be relatively simple since most asteroids are quite boring.
#


#
# Vulcanian. Always hot, close to their stars.
#
planet.Vulcanian=[Not much|Little|Barely] more than a [large|oversized] [lump of rock|rock|asteroid], $Name does not \
warrent the status of planet. It is an [irregular|potato shaped|highly irregular|elongated] lump of rock and metal, \
extremely hot and definitely inhospitable. {vulcanian.minerals}
planet.Vulcanian.1=$Name is an airless, scorched and barren rock deep within the gravity well of its star. It's surface \
is [heavily fractured|badly fractured|split open] [allowing|providing|giving] [easy|good] access to the interior which is \
rich in heavy metals and rare mineralogical [wealth|compounds|structures]. The [intense|extreme|deadly] [temperature|heat] \
at the surface however makes it [a difficult|an extremely hazerdous|a dangerous] place to reach, let alone mine.
planet.Vulcanian.2=A [highly irregular|rocky|potato shaped|elongated|cratered] [rock|asteroid] [rich|high] in heavy metals. \
{vulcanian.minerals}
planet.Vulcanian.3=This is a barren, airless and scorched asteroid orbiting close to its star. {vulcanian.minerals}
planet.Vulcanian.4=$Name is a [small potato shaped world|large elongated asteroid] that [closely|tightly] orbits \
its star. Heat from both the star and gravitational stresses have [fractured|shattered] the [barren|airless|scorched] \
surface leaving it covered in deep crevasses. {vulcanian.minerals} 

vulcanian.minerals=Such worlds [may|can] be [worth mining|cost effective to mine] since they often contain [rare|unusual] \
mineralogical compounds [not|rarely] found elsewhere. The extreme heat, and deepness of the star's gravity well makes \
$Name difficult to reach however. {vulcanian.special}
vulcanian.minerals.1=Vulcanian worlds such as this are [prized|sought after] by miners [because of|due to] their \
mineralogical wealth.  {vulcanian.special}
vulcanian.minerals.2=The [intense|extreme] [heat|temperatures] that [this world|$Name|the asteroid] \
[suffers|is under|endures] has formed rare mineral compounds which make $Name a good target for exploitation. \

natural processes.
vulcanian.unusual.3=At one point $Name was used by [pirates|smugglers|a religious cult|hermits|outlaws] \
as a [base|home|hideaway], but it has been deserted for [many hundreds of years|millenia|decades] and \
[is no longer habitable|has all but deterioted|is now but a shell|is now a tomb|is now empty].
vulcanian.unusual.4=[Strange|Unusual|Strangely regular] [seams of metal|metallic seams] criss cross \
the [crust|interior] of $Name in a way that [baffles geologists|seems unnatural|suggests severe stress].
 
vulcanian.notable=[Hidden|Sheltered] from the [sun|star] in some deep [crater|crevase] can be found \
[a small amount of water ice|some ice desposits|pools of liquid mercury|frost covered rocks].
vulcanian.notable.1=There is a [fair amount|small amount|covering of] of dust on the surface from \
previous impacts.
vulcanian.notable.2=There is a [fair amount|small amount|covering of] of dust on the surface from \

#
planet.Silicaceous=$Name is a large rocky asteroid with an olivine crust and [small|tiny] nickel-iron core. There is \

# Sideritic. Heavy in metals.
#
planet.Sideritic=A large asteroid rich in [heavy|dense] metals. It was [probably|likely] formed as part of a larger planet \
which was destroyed in a collision during the formation of the solar system, and looks like a [fragment|chunk] broken off \
from a larger body, being highly irregular in shape.
planet.Sideritic.1=$Name is a large asteroid made of [dense materials|heavy metals|mostly iron and other elements]. \
It is highly irregular in shape, being a fragment from the core of a larger planet that was destroyed in a collision. \
The cratered surface shows signs of it having been suffered many collisions itself since its formation.
planet.Sideritic.2=An irregular asteroid made mostly of nickel iron, making it a good source of minerals. The fractured \
surface shows signs of many collisions, and it lacks the size to pull itself into anything remotely resembling a sphere.
planet.Sideritic.3=A nickel iron asteroid of [large|above average] size that has found a stable orbit. $Name is quite \
spherical for asteroids of its type, [hinting|suggesting|implying] that it probably melted in the collision that \
carved it off from a parent body and [reformed|solidified] into almost a sphere.

planet.Basaltic.feature.FastRotation=The asteroid has a very fast rotational period, and a distinct bulge \
runs along the equator.
planet.Basaltic.feature.Spirals=Some of the lava flows have frozen into [geometric|strange|regular] spiral patterns, \
[probably|possibly|likely to have been] caused by a much higher rotational velocity whilst the [asteroid|world] \

planet.Mimean.trade.Va.1=The surface is mostly [ice, with a few rock fields|rock and ice|ice with some rock outcroppings], and is [barren|empty|desolate] and airless.
planet.Mimean.trade.Va.2=[Being|Since it is] [little more than an|not much more than an|a large|an oversized] asteroid, $Name [is airless|has no atmosphere|is a vacuum {world}].

# Oortean
planet.Oortean=A cold and dark world in the [deepest|darkest|furthest] reaches of the system. It is similar in composition to the \
comets which occassionally find their way into the inner solar system, but $Name is currently in a stable orbit, and likely to remain \
