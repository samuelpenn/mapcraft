techlevel.TL7=$Name is at the point where science and technology is beginning to mature at an ever increasing rate. \
Nuclear power is well understood, both as a source of energy and for weapons. Computers are beginning to increase in \
effectiveness and decrease in size, and the technology to reach space is starting to become practical. However, $Name \
is still relient on off-world tech for any real amount of space-based industry, and rapid advances in computer tech \
are more due to buying in designs from elsewhere and pulling them apart to see how they work.
