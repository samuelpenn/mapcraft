# Planet type
#
planet.ArchaeoGaian=A [young|early|developing] {world} where [most|the majority] of life is still found in the oceans.

planet.Arean=A[ dead| barren| lifeless|n empty] {world} with [no|few] evolutionary or geological processes of its own. Too small to keep much \
of an atmosphere, and [no|too little] heat from within to keep it warm, there is little here of interest except for paleo-geologists wishing \
to examine the [corpse of a world that might have been|ancient river beds and glaciated canyons].

planet.AreanLacustric=For a short while, this {world} was capable of supporting life, and [life actually florished|indeed life covered the world]. \
Within a billion years though [changes in the sun|an increasing orbit|and for unknown reasons|a local cataclysm] caused temperatures to plummet \
and the atmosphere to thin. Now, [life is practically extinct|the ecology has collapsed|massive extinction has wiped out most life], leaving \
only simple organisms surviving in a few niches. Geologically, $Name is dead. ($Hydrographics|0={areanlacustric.desert}|{areanlacustric.water})
planet.AreanLacustric.1=$Name is a ($Radius|3000>tiny|4000>small|smallish) {world} which has frozen since the early dawn of the solar system \
and is now a cold relic of an earlier age. There is [no|only very occassional|absolutely no|no decerniable] geological activity on this world, \
though there is [some|possibly some] evidence of such in the past. Though life once existed here, it is now pretty much extinct. \
($Hydrographics|0={areanlacustric.desert}|{areanlacustric.water})

areanlacustric.desert=The surface is [an arid desert|a dry wasteland|a waterless grave] with no life visible from orbit.
areanlacustric.water=A few seas surprisingly survive, [heated|warmed|kept liquid] by geothermal processes that are still active. \
They are shallow and brackish, not greatly suited to life.

planet.Cerean=This asteroid is a primitive throwback, [undisturbed|unchanged] by time. There is no real core to the world, it being an \
even mixture of various elements. There are some volatiles present, including water ice.

# EoArean
planet.EoArean=$Name is a ($Radius|3000>tiny|5000>small|undersized) {world} which is losing its atmosphere to space. As its atmosphere [thins|goes|vanishes], \

can support life, though little of what is here is truly native.
planet.EoArean.1=This is a {world} that [is too small|is not massive enough|lacks sufficient gravity] to retain an atmosphere. Eventually \
[any|all] life [will perish|will die|will die out|is doomed]. Until then, life will continue to evolve to fill all the niches that it can, \
and the harsh rules of natural selection will ensure that whatever life there is will be tough and hardy.

#
# Gaian
#
planet.EoGaian=An early [Earth-like|Terran|Garden|Gaian] {world} with a primeval atmosphere and young oceans, $Name is not yet capable of \

gaian.dry=It is [relatively|quite|very] dry [as such worlds go|compared to others worlds of its type|unlike most Gaian planets], with only \
$Hydrographics percent of its surface covered by [water|seas|oceans]. The life here [is suited|has adapted] to [such|these] conditions, and is \
hardy and tough, conserving what water it can. Much of the [plant|land] life is beneath the ground, seeking [hidden|deep] reserves of water.
gaian.dry.1=Despite this, $Name lacks any large seas or oceans, with [much of the|most] water being sub-surface. Forests tend to be sparse, with \
much of the ecology being grasslands. However, animal life is common, [insects|giant insects|birds|rodents] especially so. 
 
gaian.moderate=$Name is a [beautiful|splendid] {world} of [giant|colourful] [flowers|forests|trees] which cover [much|most] of the world. \

and now $Name is a dying place, [slowly|gradually] losing its atmosphere to space, its [ecology|biosphere] collapsing and the oceans \
are beginning to [dry|evaporate]. Life still hangs on in [a desperate|an ultimately doomed|a doomed] battle for survival as conditions \
[gradually worsen|worsen|deteriorate], but it is still a place where people can live, at least for another few hundred million years. \
($Hydrographics|30>{postgaian.desert}|60>{postgaian.dry}|{postgaian.wet})

postgaian.desert=The few seas are still a hive of activity for life, but large arid deserts make up the bulk of the land, with a few \
[struggling forests|dying woodlands|dying strips of forests] in the low valleys. Land life has [evolved|adapted] to survive in these \
harsh conditions, but [there are few large animals still alive|most large land species have gone extinct|90% of species are extinct].
postgaian.dry=Continents are bordered by inland cliffs which mark the old coasts, with [swampy flats|arid beaches|desolate wasteland] \
stretching from the cliffs to the vanishing seas. Deserts are large, and growing, and the world is dry but not yet desolate. The changing \

have long since vanished.
postgaian.wet=[Deserts|Arid regions|Dry grasslands] are beginning to encroach on [ancient forests|once lush forests|dying jungles] and life \
is [retreating|vanishing] from the [highlands|mountains] as the atmosphere leaks into space.

planet.GaianTundral=A [cold|frozen|blizzard swept|snow covered] {world}, $Name was [once a garden {world}|a much nicer {world}|much warmer in its past,] \
but is now [difficult|hard|tough] to [live|survive] on. ($Hydrographics|30>{gaiantundral.dry}|{gaiantundral.wet})
gaiantundral.dry=Most of the seas have long since frozen, though [internal heat|warmth from the planet's core|geothermal processes] still keep \
the deep oceans liquid, and warm water breaks the surface ice in places allowing life to continue to thrive [around these shores|in these places].
gaiantundral.wet=[Internal warmth|geothermal processes|The hot core] provides enough heat to the oceans to keep them free of ice, and \
though much of the land is lost to barren ice sheets, the ocean shores still provide for life.

planet.Hephaestian=Such worlds as $Name are small, hot moons of Jovian worlds, heated by gravitational friction from their parent. \
$Name is rocky, with a [massive|large] amount of volcanic activity, [pretty much ensuring that the place is|making the world] inhospitable \
to life. The volanic activity is enough to turn the {world} inside out every few [decades|hundred years|thousand years]. The surface conists \
of bare rocky outcrops, [layers|pools|rivers] of molten sulphur, and plenty of volcanic vents. There is a temporary atmosphere here, mostly \
of sulphur and other noxious gases, but it is continually lost to space, being fed from the active volcanos.

human.culture=The [people|inhabitants|locals|women|men|priests] of this {world} are [noted|well known|somewhat known|recorded] for their [strange|wierd|unusual|inexplicable|friendly] [customs|parties|celebrations|holidays|festivals|rites|compititions] [involving|with|for] [animals|sex|sport|religion|singing|fashion|dance|maths].

is still relient on off-world tech for any real amount of space-based industry, and rapid advances in computer tech \
are more due to buying in designs from elsewhere and pulling them apart to see how they work.

techlevel.TL8=This world makes heavy use of [computer|information] technology. ($PopulationLog|6>{tl8.low}|9>{tl8.mid}|{tl8.high})
tl8.low=Robots and machines do much of the [manual labour|physical work] here, and most processes are automated since there just aren't \
enough people to keep their society [working|functioning|independant] without this. Most information is stored and shared digitally, \
with good communications between groups.
tl8.mid=High levels of automation and extensive digital networks help unite the world and enable communication between different groups, \
and though people are dispersed across the {world}, travel is easy and common. {tl8.medical} {tl8.crime}
tl8.high=A world spanning internet connects the people of the world, and [most|most large|nearly all|many] companies store information \
digitally and run their operations online. Economically, the world is moving towards a service and information based culture, with \
megacorporations on the rise and [dictating|influencing] politics in [many|most|in some] [areas|regions|disciplines]. \
{tl8.medical} {tl8.entertainment} {tl8.crime}

tl8.medical=Good medical technology is available to all, and is boosted by access to Imperium drugs and knowledge.
tl8.medical.1=Medical technology can combat most diseases and has a good practical understanding of genetics. Though full \
cloning and regeneration is not yet possible without Imperium technology, the theory behind the technology is understood.
tl8.entertainment=Global entertainment networks ensure that news and entertainment are available on demand very cheaply. \
Knowledge about the Imperium is [common|freely available], and [Imperium films are highly sought after|there is a demand for \
news about the nobility|news of distant events is highly regarded].
tl8.crime=With the new technologies come new types of crimes, which the goverment is [finding hard to control|trying to combat].
tl8.crime.1=With good access to technology, offworld crime groups find digital crime here easy.
tl8.crime.2=$Name has invested heavily in higher tech security products to try and limit digital crime.

techlevel.TL9=Though backwards compared to the rest of the Imperium, $Name is [advanced|technological] enough to be able to \
manage its own manned exploration of its system, giving it an advantage when dealing with other space faring nations over its \
more backward neighbours. Computer \technology is prevalent, and micro-technology are the cutting edge of its capabilities.

techlevel.TL10=$Name is at the low end of what is considered Third Imperium technology, being capable of jump capable starships \
and interstellar trade.

techlevel.TL11=$Name is a high technology world, comparable with most of the Imperium.

techlevel.TL12=This world is at the cutting edge of Imperial science and technology. Most physical tasks are heavily automated, \
with much of human employment focused in the entertainment, services and knowledge based industries. Grav technology is extensive, \
making travel and exotic architecture the norm. Even travel to orbit is considered trivial, and space based industries make up an \
appreciable part of the world's GDP. ($PopulationLog|9>{tl12.low}|{tl12.high})
tl12.low=The planet is heavily rural, with a [distributed|low density|widely dispersed] population that has [no further|little] \
need to be based in close proximity to [commercial|urban|industrial] centres. It is rare for families not to own grav vehicles, \
and not uncommon for private ownership of orbit capable transports.
tl12.low.1=Much of the technology of $Name is hidden and subtle, given the appearance of a [much|somewhat|considerably] lower level \
of population and technology than is actually present. Many urban areas are subterranean, with most people never venturing outside \
into the wild. Given the high quality of communication, people don't often need to travel between cities.
tl12.low.2=Much of the technology of $Name is hidden and subtle, given the appearance of a [much|somewhat|considerably] lower level \
of population and technology than is actually present. A few [huge|giant|massive|floating|hidden] archologies house [most of the|the entire] \
population, with industrial complexes kept elsewhere or in orbit.
tl12.high=$Name is the stereotypical Imperial world, with huge cities filled with flying cars, transport tubes, bright holographic \
advertising displays and little difference between night and day as far as activity goes. A good fraction of the population actually \
lives and works in space, and the [distinction|difference] between ground and orbit isn't as [clear cut|important] as on other worlds.
tl12.high.1=$Name is a {world} of [floating|flying] [cities|towers|buildings] and high density urban areas. Only the poorest live on the \
surface of $Name, and that is where most the crime is located.

techlevel.TL13=This world is beyond what the Imperium is commonly capable of.
techlevel.TL14=$Name is a highly advanced world with almost magical levels of technology.

The people here are capable of handling offworld trade, and finding contacts is [moderately|reasonably] [straightforward|easy]. {port.d.staff}
starport.D.1=A single major airport [handles|has been upgraded to handle] off-world trade, providing refueling and basic repair facilities. Warehouses, \

port.c.extra.4=Local crime [syndicates|families|gangs] [run the|influence the|trying to get involved in|will need to be paid off to deal with the] \
local side of the starport.
port.c.extra.5=This port [has won an award for being|is noted as being|is well known as|is probably|could easily be] the \
[dirtiest|cleanest|smelliest|most unfriendly|friendliest] port in the [sub-sector|sector].

#
# Starport B
#
starport.B=This is a [massive|extensive|huge] starport with all the facilities traders and travellers would [need|require|want]. The surface based \
star city is fully under Imperium control, and has extensive warehouses, hotels and legal facilities to help facilitate off-world trade. Dry docks \
provide tools and manpower needed for ship repair, and even upgrades will be [commonly|easily] available [at a price|cheaply|from many local dockyards]. \
{port.b.orbital}

port.b.orbital=The orbital port is capable of handling even the largest ships, and has construction dockyards of its own, though they are \
[really only suited|better suited|designed to handle] smaller trade ships rather than military vessels or bulk transports. [Five star|High|Excellent] \
quality hotels and entertainment facilities are present, and information, trade prospects and passage can be obtained for a price.
port.b.orbital.1=A cluster of orbital docks surround $Name, providing extensive port facilities for interstellar trade. Though ship construction is \
not available, extensive repair and maintainence is possible, with [plenty|many|large numbers of] [skilled|qualified|experienced] mechanics offering \
their services. Entertainment centres are also present in orbit, for those who don't want to go planet side.

#
# Starport A
#
starport.A=As with most starports of this class, this one is closer to being a complete city than simply a place for starships to dock. \
Massive dockyards are filled with starships under construction, and a continuous stream of transports shuttle passengers and freights between \
the surface and orbit. Starports of this class are [always|heavily] under Imperium law, and exist apart from the world's local politics. \
{port.a.orbital} {port.a.extra}
starport.A.1=The starport of $Name is a [huge|sprawling|shining] metropolis of landing [ports|bays|pads|pods], refueling facility, [repair|maintenance] \
docks, hotels, [shops|shopping centres|malls] and [warehouses|conference centres|parks|entertainment facilities|restaurants]. Dozens of bulk transports \
land or take off from here [each day|on a daily basis], as well as hundreds of smaller [ships|craft|private vessels] of all types. The starport is the \
main trading centre of the {world}, so is a hub for intra-planetary travel as well.

port.a.orbital=The majority of the starport is actually in orbit, making up a planetary ring of dockyards, hotels, construction facilites and \
defense platforms. Local fighter groups ensure planetary defence, and [meson batteries|particle beam arrays|extensive missile turrets] ensure \
that any ship causing trouble will be dealt with in short order.
port.a.orbital.1=The orbital facility is a [giant|massive] space station, complete with domed gardens and zero-g areas for sports and leisure. \
Docking for smaller ships is provided in interior docking bays, whilst larger vessels dock against the many docking arms that protrude from the \
[middle|centre band|top and bottom] of the [structure|station].

port.a.extra=The staff at the starport are high quality, providing excellent service.
port.a.extra.1=This port always has the appearance of being busy, with its staff and facilities overworked and stretched to the maximum.

# Population = 0
habitable.none=Despite the apparent suitability of [this world|$Name|this planet], [there is no-one living here|nobody lives here|it has no colonists]. \
There is something [decidingly|definitely|indescribably|distinctly|unusually|powerfully] [odd|strange|unsettling|hateful] about the [place|world|planet], \
and nobody [who has settled here|who comes here|who has visited] ever stays for long. The world is not officially off-limits, but no major attempt to \
colonise it have been successful.

habitable.none.1=$Name is officially an empty world, with no long term [inhabitants|population]. The planet is [protected|defended|safe guarded] by \
[Imperium defence drones|Navy picket ships|the Scout service|the Navy] to [stop|prevent] anyone from [landing here|visiting] without permission. \
The reason for the interdiction [is a closely guarded secret|is not public|has not been made public|is due to risk of infection|unknown|due to the \
world's use for weapon testing|thought to be risk of psionic mind viruses|has something to do with ancient ruins once found here].

habitable.none.2=$Name, despite its suitability for [habitation|colonisation], is [uninhabited|unpopulated]. [Much|Most|Many] of the native species \
have [evolved|have been engineered to have] psionic defences which cause [insanity|extreme paranoia|suicidal tendencies] in off-worlders. The Navy \
keep the world interdicted because of this.     

# Population < 1,000
habitable.1k=There is only a [tiny|small] number of people living here, researching the [unsusual|strange|deadly] ecology of $Name. Access is \
generally [restricted|limited] to those [invited|cleared] by [the scout service|the research corporations based here|the Imperium science oversight \
body] due to the risks involved if the ecology is upset.

habitable.1k.1=$Name [was purchased|has been controlled|has long since been owned] by [a conglomerate of corporations|a few nobles|a rich few] who \
limit the number of people who can live here [long term|on a permanent basis].

habitable.1k.2=The beauty of this place hides a [dark|deadly|nasty] [secret|surprise] however, which means few are willing to live here. An \
insiduous virus infects any who stay here for too long, [making them part of the biosphere|greatly shortening their life].

habitable.1k.3=Despite the apparently ideal ecology, $Name is beset by frequent earthquakes of an unimaginable scale, which renders long term \
habitation almost impossible.

# Population < 100,000
habitable.100k=The world's small population means that much of $Name is untamed wilderness. Frequent earthquakes makes any large scale habitation \
[impossible|difficult|dangerous], which is why so few are willing to [live|settle] here.

habitable.100k.1=The population here is kept deliberately small, in order to preserve the natural beauty of $Name.

habitable.100k.2=The [xenophobic|racist|abusive and intolerant] nature of the [people|population] makes others unwilling to settle here.

# Population < 10,000,000
habitable.10m=The people here have little impact on the ecology, being spread out in small towns across the surface of the world. An attempt is \
being made to expand the population base, but $Name has had [social|stability] issues which have stained its reputation as a good place to live.

habitable.10m.1=$Name has a very low population, and they like it that way.

# Population < 100,000,000
habitable.100m=Apart from a few large towns, [much|most|the majority] of the population is rural.

habitable.100m.1=The population of $Name is concentrated in a few large towns and cities, with the rest of the {world} unclaimed wilderness. \
[There are plans to open it to further colonists in the future|Most of this has been put under a preservation order by the ISS].

# Population <  1,000,000,000
habitable.1b=The world is moderately populated.

# Population 1B+
habitable.billions=$Name is heavily populated.
