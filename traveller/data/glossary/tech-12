#Technology Level 12

<p>
This is the level of technology available throughout the Imperium. Worlds of
higher technology are considered to be advanced, and those of lower technology
to be somewhat backward. Most actual worlds within the Imperium cannot actually
support a TL of this level, but will generally import what they can.
