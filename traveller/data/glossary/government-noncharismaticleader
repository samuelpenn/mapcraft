#Non-Charismatic Leader

<p>
A dictatorship governed by a ruler who merely holds the position through
strength of arms, and doesn't lay claim to any special reason for being
in power other than the fact they happened to win the last coup. Such a
government tends to be grounded in realism, and may be reasonable place
to live since keeping everyone happy means less chance of a revolt.
