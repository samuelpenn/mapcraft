#Law Level 4 (Controlled)

<p>
Society is controlled, though not overly so. There is a large amount of
monitoring of civilian life and many laws restricting personal freedoms and
the freedoms of corporations. Most of the laws are there to protect people,
and to enforce some level of morality.

<p>
Freedom of speech for the most part is allowed, though in cases of national
security it can be infringed.
