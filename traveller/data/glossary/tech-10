#Technology Level 10

<p>
Technology level 10 is considered to be the minimum necessary for interstellar
travel, and it is at this level that the Jump drive was invented by the Vilani
originally.

<p>
Such worlds lack the latest in medical technology, and there are still plenty
of diseases which are considered incurable at this level. Cybernetics tends
to be slightly more common, primarily because the regrowth technologies of
11 and 12 are too expensive or difficult.
