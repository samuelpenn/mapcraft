#Civil Service

<p>
The world is almost entirely run by the civil service. The politicians
in power (either democratically elected, part of an oligarchy or
placed by corporate finances) have some control, but not much, and it
is difficult for them to enact great change since the bureacracy can
tie them up in bureacratic tape, and generally outstay them.
