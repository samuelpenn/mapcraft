#Impersonal Bureaucracy

<p>
The world is run by a civil service of bureaucrats, and doesn't even try
to pretend otherwise. The people have no say in how things are run, and
the only way to influence things is to become part of the bureaucracy.
The system is set up to resist change, and to ensure that those already
in power remain there. Because of the system, it can sometimes be very
difficult to understand who really has the power, and who should take
responsibility for disasters and mis-management.
