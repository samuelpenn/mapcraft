#Technology Level 9

<p>
Worlds of TL 9 will generally have an interplanetary - though not interstellar -
civilisation, with colonies on the other worlds of their solar system. Reasonably
efficient space travel is possible, and the basics of cloning and bioengineering
technology are beginning to become common place.

<p>
Partial AIs (Turing Personalities) start to become available at this level.
