#Enceladean

<p>
These are almost pure ice asteroids, with little or
no rock or metal content. What distinguishes these from
<a href="pcl-oortean">Oortean</a> worlds is that they are gravitationally
heated such that they have a liquid water core. As such,
these are only ever found as moons of <e>Jovian</e>
worlds.

<p>
They are similar to <a href="pcl-europan">Europan</a> worlds, but have no
rocky core.
